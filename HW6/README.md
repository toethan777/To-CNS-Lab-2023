## Intro to Splunk
So, I have some idea of what Splunk is and its use for monitoring events on computers for security. I have used it for the CTF Lab with some issues that I wanted to clear up, including the use of search operators and filtering. Just to refresh, I just wanted to go through the introduction course to better understand some of the functionality behind it. Much like my favorite cluster of Osâ€™s under Linux, it uses pipe operators to put outputted commands into other commands and utilizes wildcards to match words in a search. Another useful functionality in Splunk is creating reports which can aggregate date to create something meaningful to other users through graphs, lists, and maps. The last thing I learned which I found out about through the previous lab is dashboards. I originally used dashboards for displaying indexes which had forwarded data through the Workstation computers and virtual machines that we were given for our groups. The dashboard can be expanded to show the data that you want to see; not only that, but you can also add multiple applications for monitoring different things at once. Overall, the course had helped me clear a few things that I had in my mind for using Splunk and using it in the future.

## Windows Event ID blacklisting

blacklisted: Windows Event 4803 screensaver was dismissed; seems kind of silly to me, especially if the computer locks on sleep as policy.
