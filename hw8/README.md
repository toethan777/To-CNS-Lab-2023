## Homework 8
I have used dirb as a Security tool built-into Kali Linux by Dark Raver. It is a web content scanning tool that finds web objects that are hidden to web pages through brute force, a dictionary attack, to get into a server. The application itself can be used to perform various tests on a web server, including finding directories, guessing filenames, and finding sensitive information. An example of what it could potentially find is a secret log-on portal that only the admin of a server would know. Essentially, dirb does not find the vulnerabilities themselves nor does it look for web contents that may be vulnerable, but rather is able to find things that regular Common Gateway Interface scanner cannot find. 
Dirb is quite easy to use to get started. The things you need are access to the dirb command, a web server, and a dictionary list. Dirb itself comes with its own dictionary list through `/usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt` but the user is able to customize their own wordlist if necessary. As seen below, we can see the tool in action, finding all the potential endpoints for hidden web pages on a set-up Damn Vulnerable Web Server on our network:
